# Vector tables for the client's mirror

Each table is printed by tests of `grimworld_logic` and kept here, one JSON line per case, every
felt in hexadecimal. The tests hold a digest of every case and outcome: a change to a rule, or to
the cases, fails them until the table is regenerated (D-140, SPK-4). `check.py` closes the other
side: it runs the tests and fails while the committed file differs from what they print, so a new
digest without the regenerated file fails too (snforge cannot read a JSON-lines file from a test).

```
python3 contracts/logic/vectors/check.py           # exit 1 when a table is stale
python3 contracts/logic/vectors/check.py --write   # regenerate; prints each part's digest
```

After `--write`, set the tests' digests (and, if the first part's count moved, `PART_1`) to the
values it prints and run it again: it must say "as computed".

## `window.jsonl`: the geometry of the window (ENG-02)

Printed by `types::window::tests::test_vectors` (ids 0–1201) and `test_vectors_1` (ids
1202–2048), split for snforge's step limit, each part with its digest.

One line: `{"id", "fn", "case", "ok"}`. A position is the window's index `15 y + x` (0–239; 240 and
up is outside the window), a facing `0..=5` (East, North-East, North-West, West, South-West,
South-East), a boolean 0 or 1. `open` is the window's walkable bitmap (bit `p` is 1 for a walkable
tile `p`); the vectors use one fixture with seven walls. The arguments of `arc`, `front` and
`facing` come in one order: the acting tile, the other tile, a facing.

| `fn` | `case` | `ok` |
|---|---|---|
| `sight` | `open`, `from`, `to` | `WindowTrait::sight` (a wall at either end blocks) |
| `reach` | `open`, `from`, `to`, `range` (6) | `WindowTrait::reach` |
| `arc` | `source`, `target`, `facing` (the target's) | `Option<Arc>` as Cairo `Serde`: `[0, a]` for `Some`, `a` 0 `Front`, 1 `FrontSide`, 2 `RearSide`, 3 `Back`; `[1]` for `None` |
| `facing` | `from`, `to`, `facing` (the actor's) | the facing after the action |
| `front` | `source`, `target`, `facing` (the source's) | `WindowTrait::front` |
| `distance` | `from`, `to` | `WindowTrait::distance` |
| `shape` | `open`, `shape` (1 `SINGLE` … 5 `DISC_3`), `centre` | the bitmap of the shape's tiles |

The cases:
- `sight` and `reach`: from both row parities at the centre to every tile within 7, and the edges (a line leaving the window at a corner, a position outside).
- `arc` and `facing`: from every tile within 6 of the targets `(7, 8)` (an even row) and `(7, 7)` (an odd row), the facing turning with the source, and the edges.
- `front`: every neighbour and facing, at the centre and on the East edge.
- `distance`: from `(7, 7)`, `(7, 8)` and `(0, 0)` to every tile.
- `shape`: each shape at the corners, the edges, the centre and next to walls.
